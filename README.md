# Traffic---Management---System
A C++ console-based project to manage traffic intersections, vehicles, road networks, and traffic signals with file storage support.
# Traffic Management System ðŸš¦

## Overview
The **Traffic Management System** is a C++ console-based project that simulates managing traffic intersections, vehicles, road connections, and traffic signals. It also supports saving and loading data for persistent usage.

## Features
- Add and manage **intersections**
- Add and clear **vehicles** at intersections
- Create and clear **road connections**
- Manage **traffic signals** (Green, Yellow, Red)
- Display vehicles, intersections, and road network
- Save and load system data to/from a file

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts Used:** OOP, File Handling, Data Structures (`map`, `queue`, `vector`)
